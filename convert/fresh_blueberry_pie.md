## Recipe #109: Fresh Blueberry Pie

### Pastry for 9-inch double crust, p 924
- 1 tbsp fine dry white bread crumbs, p 985
- 4 qt blueberries

#### Ingredients:
- 3 tbsp flour
- 1 cup sugar
- Dash of salt
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp butter, optional

#### Instructions:
Adjust rack 4 or 5 inches above bottom of oven. Start oven 30 min before baking; set to hot (450° F).

Make pastry; roll out ⅔ of it and line a 9-inch pie pan, fitting well into angles; trim off even with pan rim. Sprinkle crumbs evenly over bottom of pastry-lined pan. Roll out remaining pastry for top crust; cut design in center for wide-open steam vents. Pick over berries, discarding damaged ones and wash thoroughly in cold water. Drain. Blend flour with sugar and salt and sprinkle ⅔ cup of it over crumbs, then turn in berries, spreading out compactly. Drizzle lemon juice over berries; then sprinkle rest of sugar mixture over top. Dot with butter, then moisten edge of lower pastry; lay on top pastry. Press gently around edge to seal. Trim off top pastry with scissors ½-inch beyond pan rim. Fold overhang under bottom pastry so fold is even with pan rim. Again press gently to seal, then crimp edge with tines of a fork. Bake 12 to 15 min or until pastry begins to brown, then reduce heat to moderately slow (325° F) and bake 20 to 25 min longer or until pastry is nicely browned and juice bubbles up through vents. Remove to cake rack to cool to lukewarm. 5 to 6 servings.
