## Description

Bright, citrusy scones featuring tart cranberries and fresh orange zest. The combination of flavors is refreshing and festive, making these perfect for holiday brunches.

## Ingredients

- 4 cup. flour
- 4 t. baking powder
- ¾ C. sugar
- 1 t. salt
- Grated orange peel from 1 orange
- 1 cup. butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces
- 2 large eggs
- ⅓ C. frozen orange juice
- ⅓ C. milk
- ¾ to 1 Cup (to suit taste) of fresh or frozen cranberries
- 2 Tbsp of light brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Coat cranberries with brown sugar, distributing the sugar so as many cranberries as possible get coated.

2. Combine dry ingredients plus grated orange peel; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. In small bowl, whisk eggs, orange juice and milk.

4. (Save a couple of tablespoons to brush tops of scones before baking.) Stir into flour mixture, combining until dough is moist.

5. If it is too sticky to handle, add a bit more flour.

6. Mix in the cranberries.

7. Turn dough onto floured work surface; knead a few turns.
