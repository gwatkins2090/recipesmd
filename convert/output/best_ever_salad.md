## Description

A crowd-pleasing salad that lives up to its name. The combination of fresh ingredients and flavorful dressing makes this a standout side dish.

## Ingredients

- 1 pkg lime Jello
- 1 pkg lemon Jello
- 2 cup very hot water
- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 3 Tbsp horseradish (or to suit taste)
- 1 cup drained crushed pineapple
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 2 Tbsp thinly sliced pimento
- ½ cup chopped celery

## Instructions

1. Dissolve gelatin in hot water, cool, add remaining ingredients. Chill until set.

2. Serve with mayonnaise or lettuce leaf.

3. This salad is delicious with ham, chicken or roast turkey.

4. The horseradish may be omitted but it makes it good and different — (I use about one tablespoon horseradish and about ⅔ cup mayonnaise for calories sake)

5. (Use horseradish to suit taste)
