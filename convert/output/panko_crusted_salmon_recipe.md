## Description

Salmon fillets coated in crispy panko breadcrumbs and baked until golden. The Japanese-style breadcrumbs create an extra-crunchy crust.

## Ingredients

- 4 tsp olive oil
- 4 pieces thickly cut, boneless salmon (each 6 oz)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 Tbsp honey mustard or sweet-hot mustard
- 2 tsp chopped fresh thyme
- ⅔ cup panko bread crumbs
- 2 Tbsp chopped Italian parsley
- ½ tsp Hungarian sweet paprika

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (convection or regular). Set the salmon on a foil-lined baking sheet skin side down. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

2. In a small bowl, combine the honey mustard and 1 teaspoon of the thyme.

3. In another small bowl, mix the panko with the remaining 1 teaspoon of thyme, 4 teaspoons of olive oil, parsley, and paprika.

4. Add salt and pepper (a light sprinkle).
