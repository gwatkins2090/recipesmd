## Description

A sweet and creamy grape salad that's always a hit at potlucks. The combination of grapes, cream cheese, and pecans is surprisingly addictive.

## Ingredients

- 2 lb red or green seedless grapes
- 8 oz cream cheese
- 8 oz sour cream
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 1 cup pecans (optional)
- 1 cup brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Mix top ingredients and put in 9 x 13 dish.

2. Put pecan/brown sugar mixture on top of grape mixture and let set. Salad is better after it has set for 2 or 3 hours.

3. (I have used grapes whole and cut in half -- either way works, your choice. I usually wash grapes and set aside. Mix cream cheese, sour cream, and vanilla and then stir in grapes, whole or half.)
