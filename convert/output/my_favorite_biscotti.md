## Description

Crunchy, twice-baked Italian cookies perfect for dunking in coffee or tea. These biscotti have just the right amount of sweetness and a satisfying crunch.

## Ingredients

- 3 ½ cup unbleached all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ¾ tsp salt
- 4 large eggs, 2 egg yolks, and one egg white for brushing
- 2 cup granulated sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
- 2 tsps. vanilla extract
- 2 Tbsp. almond liqueur, such as Disaronno
- 1 Tbsp. anise seed
- 4 cup coarsely chopped whole almonds

## Instructions

1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle and upper positions and heat oven to 325°F. Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl.

3. Beat eggs, egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light, about 3 minutes; beat in vanilla, liqueur and anise.

4. Beat in dry ingredients and then almonds to form sticky dough.

5. Divide dough into four portions on a heavily floured board and rolling each portion into an approximate 15- by 2-inch log.

6. Carefully transfer 2 logs to each baking sheet, brushing each with egg white and sprinkling with sugar.

7. Bake until pale golden and just beginning to crack, 20 to 25 minutes.

8. Cool cookie logs on baking sheet until tepid, about 10 minutes.

9. Keeping loaves in position, heat oven to 200°F.

10. Slice logs crosswise, 3/4-inch thick with a serrated knife, laying slices on baking sheets in single layer.

11. (There will be enough cookies for 4 to 6 sheets.) Working 2 sheets at a time, bake biscotti until crisp 2 and golden, about 25 minutes.

12. Remove from oven and cool.

13. (Can be stored in airtight container up to 2 weeks.)
