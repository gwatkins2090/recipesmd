## Description

A festive quick bread featuring tart cranberries and crunchy nuts. The cranberries provide bursts of tangy flavor that balance the sweet bread perfectly.

## Ingredients

- 2 cup flour
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- 1 ½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp salt
- ¾ cup coarsely chopped walnuts
- 1 cup chopped cranberries
- ¾ cup orange juice
- ¼ cup butter, melted
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 Tbsp grated orange peel

## Instructions

1. Pre-heat oven to 350°F.

2. Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the chopped cranberries and walnuts to coat with the flour mixture.

3. Mix together orange juice, butter, egg, and orange peel. Add to flour, cranberry, nut mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just blended.

4. Pour into a greased 9x5 or 8x4 loaf pan. Bake at 350°F for 55 to 60 minutes or until done (a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean).

5. Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.
