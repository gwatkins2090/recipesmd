## Description

Rich, tender biscuits made with sour cream for extra moisture and flavor. The sour cream creates an incredibly soft texture and adds a subtle tang that pairs perfectly with butter and jam.

## Ingredients

- 1 - 8 oz sour cream
- 2 - sticks oleo or butter
- 2 - cup self-rising flour

## Instructions

1. Mix all ingredients thoroughly. I do so by hand.

2. Bake in regular muffin pan at 400°F until brown, or

3. Bake at 375°F if you use no-stick pan.

## Notes

I prefer the no-stick (Teflon lined) pan that makes 24 small muffins, just the right number for this recipe. This pan has the brand-name of Wilton. Each cup is 1¾ inches in diameter at the top.
