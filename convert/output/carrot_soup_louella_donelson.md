## Description

Louella Donelson's smooth, slightly sweet carrot soup. The carrots are pureed until silky, creating an elegant first course or light lunch.

## Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp. Butter
- ½ cup chopped Onion
- 4 cup. clear (fat free) Chicken Broth
- 3 cup thinly sliced Carrots
- ½ cup diced Potato
- ½ tsp Sugar
- ½ tsp grated Orange Rind
- ¼ tsp ground Nutmeg
- ½ tsp Salt
- 1 cup ½ & ½ Cream

## Instructions

1. Cook onion in butter until clear; add chicken broth, carrots, potato, sugar, orange peel, nutmeg, salt and simmer (covered) until vegetables are very soft.

2. Whirl in electric blender (½ at a time) until creamy.

3. Return to pan, stir in ½ & ½ and heat.

4. If too much, half it.

5. If keep in refrigerator (only couple days) add ½ & ½ to that portion when serving.

6. Use a bit of lemon juice if don't have orange peel.

7. If don't have chicken broth, I imagine instant broth would be O.K.

8. This is very delicious, does not taste like carrots. Full of vitamins of course and good any time.
