## Description

Southern-style catfish with a flavorful preparation that highlights the mild, sweet fish. This recipe turns catfish into an elegant dinner.

## Ingredients

- 6 to 8 catfish fillets
- 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- ½ cup butter or margarine, softened
- 6 Tbsp mayonnaise
- 6 green onions, chopped fine
- ½ tsp Worcestershire sauce
- generous dash Tabasco

## Instructions

1. Place the cheese, butter, mayonnaise, onion, Worcestershire and Tabasco in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Butter mixture may be made 24 hours ahead and kept refrigerated.

2. Poach the catfish fillets in lightly simmering water for 4 to 5 minutes. Gently lift the fillets from the water and set aside to drain.

3. For individual servings, place the fillets in au gratin dishes and cover with 2 tablespoons of the cheese mixture. Broil for 2 to 3 minutes until the cheese mixture browns.

4. Without individual dishes, place fillets into a lightly baking dish.

5. Cover each fillet with the cheese mixture and brown under the broiler.

6. Carefully lift the fillets from the dish onto the plates and spoon some of the pan juices over each serving.
