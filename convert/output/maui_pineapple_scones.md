## Description

Tropical-inspired scones with sweet pineapple pieces throughout. These bring a taste of the islands to your breakfast table with their buttery texture and fruity flavor.

## Ingredients

- 2 cup all-purpose flour
- ½ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ½ cup cold Land O Lakes® Butter
- ½ cup sweetened flaked coconut
- ½ cup macadamia and cashew mix, chopped
- ¼ cup crushed pineapple, drained, reserve 1 Tbsp juice
- 2 Land O Lakes® Eggs
- 2 Tbsp sweetened flaked coconut

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 400°F.

2. Combine flour, brown sugar and baking powder in bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. Stir in ½ cup coconut and macadamia cashew mix.

4. (You may substitute any type of nuts you wish.)

5. Beat pineapple, reserved pineapple juice and eggs in another bowl until well mixed; stir pineapple mixture into flour mixture (mixture may be slightly dry).

6. Knead about 10 times or until mixture forms a dough, adding small amount of flour, if necessary.

7. Divide dough in half. Pat each half into 6-inch circle. Place onto large ungreased baking sheet. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Do not separate. Sprinkle each circle with 1 tablespoon coconut.

8. Bake 13-15 minutes or until scones are lightly browned. Separate into individual scones.
