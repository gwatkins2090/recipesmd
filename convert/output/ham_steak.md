## Description

Glazed ham steak that's quick to prepare and full of flavor. Perfect for a fast weeknight dinner or special breakfast.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup brown sugar
- Â½ cup vinegar
- 2 or 3 whole cloves
- 2 Tbsp prepared mustard

1. Simmer this for 5 minutes and pour over ham steak and marinate for 4 hours. (I turn the steak over 2 or 3 times while marinating).

3. Cook on outdoor grill over low fire about 45 minutes (depending on how thick the steak is) turning every 5 to 10 minutes.
