## Description

A fun twist on meatloaf with pizza flavors baked right in. Kids and adults alike love this creative combination of two family favorites.

## Ingredients

- A meat loaf turned - filled wet and filled with tomato and cheese.

## Instructions

1. Bake 425°F for 35 minutes. Serves 6 at 280 Calories each.

2. 1½ lbs. extra lean ground pork

3. 1 teaspoon salt

4. ¼ teaspoon pepper

5. ¼ to ½ teaspoon garlic powder or to suit taste

6. 1 cup tomato sauce or pizza sauce

7. 3 oz. shredded part skim mozzarella

8. 1 tablespoon leaf oregano, crumbled

9. Sprinkle ground meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Gently pat into a 10-inch pie plate, building the rim. Bake in hot oven (425°F) 15 minutes.

10. Add tomato or pizza sauce and sprinkle with cheese and oregano. Bake 10 minutes longer, or until hot and bubbly. Drain off any fat.

11. - Chopped peppers (green), mushroom slices, onions or whatever else you like on pizza are all good additions - Anything but sausage. Serve in wedges.

12. - This is another of our favorites! I use ¼ tsp. garlic.

13. They then slightly and keep apart from slices. They can be frozen quickly on cookie sheet and store in plastic bag. This method will prevent sticking together.

14. (I use the lean ground beef.) Another version of stuffing:

15. 1½ lbs. coarsely ground cooked meat or lean ground beef cooked until all pink is gone. (Lean beef)

16. 2 eggs, slightly beaten

17. ½ cup finely minced onion

18. 1 cup dried bread crumbs

19. ½ tsp. salt (optional)

20. ¾ to 1 tsp. oregano - crushed

21. 1/8 tsp. pepper (salt & taste)

22. Moisten with milk if desired. Mix thoroughly and proceed as in previous recipe.
