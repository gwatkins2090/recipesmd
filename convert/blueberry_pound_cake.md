## Recipe #102: Blueberry Pound Cake

### Ingredients:
- ½ cup butter
- 3 eggs
- 3½ cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp salt
- 2 cups sugar
- 4 cups fresh blueberries
- 1 cup milk

### Directions:
Allow butter and eggs to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, grease 10-inch tube pan; set aside.

In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder and salt. Set aside.

In a very large mixing bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer on medium speed until the mixture is well-combined. Beat in eggs.

Stir blueberries into flour mixture.

By hand, stir blueberry mixture into butter mixture. Stir in milk just until combined.

Spread batter into prepared pan.

Bake in 325 degrees oven for 60-75 minutes or until a wooden skewer inserted near center comes out clean.

Cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Loosen cake for the edges of the pan with a narrow metal spatula. Remove cake from pan. Cool on wire rack.

Makes 10-12 servings.
