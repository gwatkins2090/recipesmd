## Recipe #83: Black Bottom Pie

**Ingredients:**
- 3 cups milk
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup flour
- 4 eggs, separated
- 1 envelope unflavored gelatin
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 1 (1 oz.) square semi-sweet chocolate
- 2 tsp. vanilla
- 1 baked pie shell or graham cracker crust
- 1/2 cup whipped cream

**Instructions:**
1. Scald milk. Mix 3/4 cups of sugar and flour thoroughly. Stir into milk.
2. Beat egg yolks until lemon colored. Gradually add milk mixture, stirring constantly.
3. Cook over low heat stirring until mixture thickens. Soften gelatin in cold water, add to mixture and stir until dissolved.
4. Divide mixture into two equal parts. To one part add cut up chocolate and stir until melted. Add one teaspoon of vanilla and stir. Cool, turn into pie shell.
5. Beat two of the egg whites. Add 1/4 cup of sugar. Add second teaspoon of vanilla. Fold egg whites into remaining cooled mixture. Spread over chocolate filling. Chill. Spread whipped cream on top. Grate a little chocolate on top of whipped cream.

**Note:** This is original recipe - I changed to - Add the 1 cup sugar to flour. If mixture is not thick when cooked add two envelopes of unflavored gelatin - Instead of adding beaten egg whites & folded in 1/4 cup or more of fat free cool whip - Grated of whipped cream & spread some cool whip on top.
