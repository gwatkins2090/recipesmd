## 35. Pickapeppa Marinated Chicken

**Ingredients:**
- 2 T Red Wine Vinegar
- 2 T Pickapeppa Sauce
- 1 T Worcestershire Sauce
- 1 T Oil
- 1 T Soy Sauce

**Instructions:**
1. Marinate boneless chicken breast 8 hours up to overnight.
2. Grill to perfection on the BBQ grill.
3. Marinates 4-5 chicken breast depending on size.

**Note:** I like to double the marinate for added flavor. If you cook extra chicken this is so good left over and cut up on a green salad.
