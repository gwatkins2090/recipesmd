## 15. Carrot Soup (Louella Donelson)

**Ingredients:**
- 2 Tbsp. Butter
- ½ cup chopped Onion
- 4 cups. clear (fat free) Chicken Broth
- 3 cups thinly sliced Carrots
- ½ cup diced Potato
- ½ tsp. Sugar
- ½ tsp grated Orange Rind
- ¼ tsp. ground Nutmeg
- ½ tsp. Salt
- 1 cup ½ & ½ Cream

**Instructions:**
Cook onion in butter until clear; add chicken broth, carrots, potato, sugar, orange peel, nutmeg, salt and simmer (covered) until vegetables are very soft. Whirl in electric blender (½ at a time) until creamy. Return to pan, stir in ½ & ½ and heat. Makes 6 cups.

If too much, half it. If keep in refrigerator (only couple days) add ½ & ½ to that portion when serving. Use a bit of lemon juice if don't have orange peel. If don't have chicken broth, I imagine instant broth would be O.K.

This is very delicious, does not taste like carrots. Full of vitamins of course and good any time.
