## 53. Meat Loaf Pizza

**Ingredients:**
- A meat loaf turned - filled wet and filled with tomato and cheese.

**Instructions:**
1. Bake 425° for 35 min. Serves 6 at 280 Calories each.
2. 1½ lbs. extra lean ground pork
3. 1 teaspoon salt
4. ¼ teaspoon pepper
5. ¼ to ½ teaspoon garlic powder or to suit taste
6. 1 cup tomato sauce or pizza sauce
7. 3 oz. shredded part skim mozzarella
8. 1 tablespoon leaf oregano, crumbled

**Instructions:**
1. Sprinkle ground meat with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Gently pat into a 10-inch pie plate, building the rim. Bake in hot oven (425°) 15 min.
2. Add tomato or pizza sauce and sprinkle with cheese and oregano. Bake 10 min longer, or until hot and bubbly. Drain off any fat.

**Additional notes:**
- Chopped peppers (green), mushroom slices, onions or whatever else you like on pizza are all good additions - Anything but sausage. Serve in wedges.
- This is another of our favorites! I use ¼ tsp. garlic.

**Instructions continued:**
They then slightly and keep apart from slices. They can be frozen quickly on cookie sheet and store in plastic bag. This method will prevent sticking together.

(I use the lean ground beef.) Another version of stuffing:

1½ lbs. coarsely ground cooked meat or lean ground beef cooked until all pink is gone. (Lean beef)
2 eggs, slightly beaten
½ cup finely minced onion
1 cup dried bread crumbs
½ tsp. salt (optional)
¾ to 1 tsp. oregano - crushed
1/8 tsp. pepper (salt & taste)

Moisten with milk if desired. Mix thoroughly and proceed as in previous recipe.
