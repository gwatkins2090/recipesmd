## Recipe #101: Ice Box Fruit Cake

### Ingredients:
- 1 big box honey graham crackers
- 1 10-16 oz. jar maraschino cherries
- 1 stick butter, or oleo
- ½ box raisins
- ¼ cup raisins if desired

Add enough pecans to suit your taste

- 1 large package of marshmallows

### Instructions:
Melt marshmallows and butter over low heat. Add crushed graham crackers, cherries, raisins and nuts. Mix well put into buttered loaf pan and refrigerate 12 hours or longer. Remove from pan and wrap in foil or plastic wrap.

Remove cake from pan. Wrap in aluminum foil or plastic wrap.

Note: We like it without raisins, but you will need more cherries. Cake keeps refrigerated for weeks. We cut the slices we want to eat and return uncut loaf to refrigerator.
