## 19. Delicious Ham and Potato Soup

**Ingredients:**
- 3 1/2 cups peeled and diced potatoes
- 1/3 cup diced celery
- 1/3 cup finely chopped onion
- 3/4 cup diced cooked ham
- 3 1/4 cups water
- 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon granules
- 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
- 1 teaspoon ground white or black pepper, or to taste
- 5 tablespoons butter
- 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 2 cups milk

**Cooking Instructions:**
Combine the potatoes, celery, onion, ham and water in a stockpot. Bring to a boil, then cook over medium heat until potatoes are tender, about 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the chicken bouillon, salt and pepper.

In separate saucepan, melt butter over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour with fork, and cook, stirring constantly until thick, about 1 minute. Slowly stir in milk as not to allow lumps to form until all milk has been added. Continue stirring over medium-low heat until thick, 4 to 5 minutes.

Stir milk mixture into stockpot, and cook soup until heated through. Serve immediately.
