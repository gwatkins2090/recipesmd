# Conversion Script Updates - October 8, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Review Flagging Logic for Vague Quantities

**Problem:** The script was incorrectly flagging traditional recipe conventions as "incomplete quantities":
- "to taste" phrases (e.g., "salt and pepper to taste")
- Small measurements (e.g., "1/4 tsp", "1/8 tsp")
- Acceptable vague phrases for seasonings (e.g., "very little salt")

**Solution:** Updated `review-checker.js` to exclude these acceptable patterns:

#### Changes in `hasIncompleteQuantities()` function:
```javascript
// BEFORE: Flagged all "to taste" as vague
if (lower.match(/some |a little |to taste|as needed/)) {
  return true;
}

// AFTER: Excludes acceptable traditional phrases
if (lower.match(/some |a little (?!salt|pepper|seasoning)/) &&
    !lower.match(/to taste|or to taste|as needed/)) {
  return true;
}
```

#### Changes in `findIncompleteQuantities()` function:
```javascript
// BEFORE: Flagged all "to taste" phrases
if (lower.match(/some |a little |to taste|as needed/)) {
  issues.push(`Line ${index + 1}: "${ingredient}" - vague quantity`);
}

// AFTER: Only flags truly vague quantities
if (lower.match(/some (?!salt|pepper|seasoning)|a little (?!salt|pepper|seasoning)/) &&
    !lower.match(/to taste|or to taste|as needed/)) {
  issues.push(`Line ${index + 1}: "${ingredient}" - vague quantity`);
}
```

**Impact:**
- Incomplete quantities flagged: **12 ‚Üí 2 recipes** (83% reduction!)
- Only truly problematic quantities are now flagged
- Traditional recipe conventions are respected

### 2. Updated Default Author to "Maw Maw"

**Problem:** All recipes without a specific author were attributed to "Family Recipe Collection" and flagged as "Author unknown - using default" in the review report.

**Solution:** Updated default author to "Maw Maw" and removed author from review flagging:

#### Changes in `metadata-generator.js`:
```javascript
// BEFORE
author: parsed.author || 'Family Recipe Collection',

// AFTER
author: parsed.author || 'Maw Maw',
```

#### Changes in description template:
```javascript
// BEFORE
return templates[category] || `A classic ${title.toLowerCase()} recipe from our family collection.`;

// AFTER
return templates[category] || `A classic ${title.toLowerCase()} recipe from Maw Maw's collection.`;
```

#### Changes in `review-checker.js` - `getMissingMetadata()`:
```javascript
// BEFORE
if (!parsed.author) {
  missing.push('Author unknown - using default');
}

// AFTER
// Don't flag missing author - "Maw Maw" is an acceptable default for family recipes
// (commented out)
```

**Impact:**
- All recipes now attributed to "Maw Maw" by default
- Author field no longer flagged in review report
- More appropriate attribution for family recipe collection
