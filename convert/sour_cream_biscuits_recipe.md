## 2. Sour Cream Biscuits Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 1 - 8 oz. sour cream
- 2 - sticks oleo or butter
- 2 - cups self-rising flour

**Instructions:**
Mix all ingredients thoroughly. I do so by hand.

Bake in regular muffin pan at 400 degrees until brown, or
Bake at 375 degrees if you use no-stick pan.

**Note:**
I prefer the no-stick (Teflon lined) pan that makes 24 small muffins, just the right number for this recipe. This pan has the brand-name of Wilton. Each cup is 1Â¾ inches in diameter at the top.
