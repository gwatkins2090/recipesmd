## 9. Grape Salad

**Ingredients:**
- 2 lbs. red or green seedless grapes
- 8 oz. cream cheese
- 8 oz. sour cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla

**For topping:**
- 1 cup pecans (optional)
- 1 cup brown sugar

**Instructions:**
Mix top ingredients and put in 9 x 13 dish.

Put pecan/brown sugar mixture on top of grape mixture and let set. Salad is better after it has set for 2 or 3 hours.

(I have used grapes whole and cut in half -- either way works, your choice. I usually wash grapes and set aside. Mix cream cheese, sour cream, and vanilla and then stir in grapes, whole or half.)
