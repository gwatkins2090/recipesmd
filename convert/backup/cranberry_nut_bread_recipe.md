## Recipe #94: Cranberry Nut Bread Recipe

One of the great blessings of living in California is our abundance of produce year round. Walnuts are in season, as are navel oranges. Buy an orange and squeeze it fresh to get the best juice for this recipe (grate the peel first). Frozen cranberries work well, just slice them in half. I've seen suggestions online to pulse the cranberries in a food processor as a way to more easily chop them, but I think you could easily get too many small bits using that method. The best results will come from chopping them yourself, all they need is to be cut in half, just cut a few at a time to keep them from rolling off the table. The result is a tangy, slightly sweet bread with occasional explosions of cranberry tartness, mellowed with walnuts.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups flour
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3/4 cup coarsely chopped walnuts
- 1 cup chopped cranberries
- 3/4 cup orange juice
- 1/4 cup butter, melted
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1 Tbsp grated orange peel

**Instructions:**
1. Pre-heat oven to 350°F.
2. Mix the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add the chopped cranberries and walnuts to coat with the flour mixture.
3. Mix together orange juice, butter, egg, and orange peel. Add to flour, cranberry, nut mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until just blended.
4. Pour into a greased 9x5 or 8x4 loaf pan. Bake at 350°F for 55 to 60 minutes or until done (a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean).
5. Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool on a wire rack.

**Serves 8.**
