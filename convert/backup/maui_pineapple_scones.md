## 67. Maui (Pineapple) Scones

**Ingredients:**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ½ cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder

- ½ cup sweetened flaked coconut
- ½ cup macadamia and cashew mix, chopped

**Directions:**
1. Heat oven to 400°F.
2. Combine flour, brown sugar and baking powder in bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in ½ cup coconut and macadamia cashew mix. (You may substitute any type of nuts you wish.)
3. Beat pineapple, reserved pineapple juice and eggs in another bowl until well mixed; stir pineapple mixture into flour mixture (mixture may be slightly dry). Knead about 10 times or until mixture forms a dough, adding small amount of flour, if necessary.
