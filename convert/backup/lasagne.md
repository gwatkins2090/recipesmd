## 55. Lasagne

*Please make 2 recipes. (Adagil 5 Jan) Good → Dot Brown 315 East 19th*

**Ingredients:**
- 1 lb. Ground Beef
- 2 - 8 oz. cans tomato sauce
- ½ TBS. Garlic Powder
- 1 tsp. salt & 1 tsp. pepper
- 2 TBS. cooking oil
- 1 tsp. sugar
- ½ package Lasagne noodles
- 1 - 3 oz. package cream cheese
- ½ pint sour cream
- 8 green onions & tops (chopped)

**Instructions:**
**STEP 1.** Brown beef - add next 5 ingredients and simmer covered 20 minutes.

**STEP 2.** Cook lasagne noodles.

**STEP 3.** Whip the next 3 ingredients together until well mixed.

In a greased dish (13x9) put a layer of lasagne noodles to cover bottom. Then spread ½ cream cheese mixture on noodles; then ½ meat mixture on top of cream cheese mixture; then repeat once. Top with 12 oz. grated cheddar cheese. Bank 350° for 45 minutes. Let set up about 30 minutes before cutting.

Lasagne should be in this order: noodles, cream cheese mixture, meat mixture, noodles, cream cheese mixture, meat mixture, grated cheese.

**Note added:** I put 3 layers of everything. I know it will seem skimpy with the cheese mixture that it all worked out -
