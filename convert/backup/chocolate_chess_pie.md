## Recipe #108: Chocolate Chess Pie

### Ingredients:
- 1½ cups sugar
- 3 tablespoon cocoa
- ¼ cup melted butter
- 2 eggs slightly beaten
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1 small can evaporated milk (5 oz)
- 1 tea spoon vanilla

### Instructions:
Mix sugar and cocoa, then add melted butter, mix, then add eggs and salt, mix. Then add milk and vanilla and beat with mixer 2½ minutes.

Pour into 8 or 9-inch unbaked pie shell and bake at 350 for 35 to 45 minutes. (I bake mine for 45 min.)

Note: This pie is very good with or without Cool Whip Topping or Pure Whipped Cream. Nuts may be added to the topping or in the filling.
