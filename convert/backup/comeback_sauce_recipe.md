## 7. Comeback Sauce Recipe

This versatile sauce has many uses. It's a dip for vegetables and chips, a salad dressing, a sauce for seafood or a sandwich spread. I will be serving mine tonight with Salmon Patties. It is good on EVERYTHING, except Cheerios. Here's my version that makes a pint jar full.

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup Duke's mayonnaise (one of my Favorites)
- ¼ cup Heinz ketchup
- ¼ cup chili sauce (I prefer Heinz or DelMonte. DO NOT substitute Thai Chili Sauce)
- 1 heaping teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- ¼ teaspoon Tabasco sauce
- ¼ cup light olive oil
- juice of one lemon

**Instructions:**
Mix all ingredients well and store in refrigerator overnight. It needs to sit to let the flavors become "acquainted". They shouldn't rush into marriage.
