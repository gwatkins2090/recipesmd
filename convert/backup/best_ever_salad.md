## 11. Best Ever Salad

**Ingredients:**
- 1 pkg lime Jello
- 1 pkg lemon Jello
- 2 cups very hot water
- 1 cup cottage cheese
- 1 cup mayonnaise
- 3 tablespoon horseradish (or to suit taste)
- 1 cup drained crushed pineapple
- ½ cup chopped pecans
- 2 tablespoon thinly sliced pimento
- ½ cup chopped celery

**Instructions:**
Dissolve gelatin in hot water, cool, add remaining ingredients. Chill until set.

Serve with mayonnaise or lettuce leaf.

This salad is delicious with ham, chicken or roast turkey. The horseradish may be omitted but it makes it good and different — (I use about one tablespoon horseradish and about ⅔ cup mayonnaise for calories sake)

(Use horseradish to suit taste)
