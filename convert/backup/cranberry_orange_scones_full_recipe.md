## 69. Cranberry Orange Scones – Full Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 4 C. flour
- 4 t. baking powder
- ¾ C. sugar
- 1 t. salt
- Grated orange peel from 1 orange
- 1 C. butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces
- 2 large eggs
- ⅓ C. frozen orange juice
- ⅓ C. milk
- ¾ to 1 Cup (to suit taste) of fresh or frozen cranberries
- 2 tablespoons of light brown sugar

**Instructions:**
1. Coat cranberries with brown sugar, distributing the sugar so as many cranberries as possible get coated.
2. Combine dry ingredients plus grated orange peel; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. In small bowl, whisk eggs, orange juice and milk. (Save a couple of tablespoons to brush tops of scones before baking.) Stir into flour mixture, combining until dough is moist. If it is too sticky to handle, add a bit more flour. Mix in the cranberries.
4. Turn dough onto floured work surface; knead a few turns.
