## ✅ What Can Be Automated (90%)

### Automated Conversions:
1. ✅ **Extract titles** - Remove recipe numbers, clean formatting
2. ✅ **Generate slugs** - From filenames (black_bottom_pie.md → black-bottom-pie)
3. ✅ **Standardize headers** - Convert all to H2 (##)
4. ✅ **Convert instructions** - Paragraph blocks to numbered lists
5. ✅ **Standardize temperatures** - 350 degrees → 350°F
6. ✅ **Standardize times** - 30 min → 30 minutes
7. ✅ **Standardize units** - c → cup, tsp. → tsp
8. ✅ **Extract metadata** - Pull times/servings from text
9. ✅ **Infer categories** - Based on title/ingredients
10. ✅ **Infer difficulty** - Based on step count/complexity
11. ✅ **Generate tags** - From ingredients, category, techniques
12. ✅ **Infer generation** - Based on recipe characteristics
13. ✅ **Extract notes** - Move to separate section
14. ✅ **Add default dates** - Use current date or file date

## ⚠️ What Needs Manual Review (10%)

### Manual Tasks:
1. ⚠️ **Incomplete quantities** - "tuna" → "1 can (5 oz) tuna"
2. ⚠️ **Vague instructions** - "Bake 15 min" → detailed steps
3. ⚠️ **Missing times** - Estimate or research
4. ⚠️ **Verify categories** - Check auto-inferred categories
5. ⚠️ **Add descriptions** - Write or use AI assistance
6. ⚠️ **Review difficulty** - Verify auto-assigned levels
7. ⚠️ **Add equipment** - List special tools needed
8. ⚠️ **Enhance notes** - Add tips and variations

**Estimated Manual Work:** 10-15 recipes out of 115 will need significant manual attention

## ❓ Questions to Consider

1. **Description Generation:**
   - Write manually for all 115 recipes?
   - Use AI to generate drafts for review?
   - Start with simple descriptions, enhance later?

2. **Optional Fields:**
   - Include all optional fields in Phase 1?
   - Start minimal, add fields later?
   - Which fields are most valuable?

3. **Incomplete Recipes:**
   - Flag for review and skip for now?
   - Attempt to complete with research?
   - Mark as "draft" until completed?

4. **Photos:**
   - Add placeholder images?
   - Leave empty for now?
   - Plan photo shoot for recipes?

5. **Nutrition Information:**
   - Calculate for all recipes?
   - Add only for popular recipes?
   - Skip for Phase 1?

## 📞 Ready to Proceed?

I'm ready to create the automated conversion script once you:

1. ✅ Approve the standardized format
2. ✅ Decide which optional fields to include
3. ✅ Choose approach for descriptions (manual/AI/simple)
4. ✅ Confirm handling of incomplete recipes

The script will:
- Backup all original files
