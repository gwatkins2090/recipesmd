# Pickapeppa Marinated Chicken

## Ingredients

- 2 T Red Wine Vinegar
- 2 T Pickapeppa Sauce
- 1 T Worcestershire Sauce
- 1 T Oil
- 1 T Soy Sauce

## Instructions

Marinate boneless chicken breast 8 hours up to overnight. Grill to perfection on the BBQ grill.

Marinates 4-5 chicken breast depending on size.

## Notes

I like to double the marinade for added flavor. If you cook extra chicken this is so good left over and cut up on a green salad.
