# Cream Puff Filling

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 tablespoon flour
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 tablespoon unflavored gelatin (or 1/2 packet)
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 1 egg (beaten)
- 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup whipping cream
- 2 tablespoons sugar (for whipped cream)

## Instructions

1. Mix together first 5 ingredients (sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt, gelatin).

2. Stir in milk.

3. Cook over medium heat until thick, stirring constantly.

4. Add a little hot mixture to beaten egg to temper it, then return to pan.

5. Cook until thick.

6. Add 1Â½ teaspoon vanilla and cool completely.

7. Whip cream with 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.

8. Fold whipped cream into cooled custard.

## Notes

- Stabilized whipped cream filling using gelatin
- Gelatin helps filling hold its shape in cream puffs
- Must cool custard completely before folding in whipped cream
- Richer than Part-130 version (includes whipped cream)
- Tempering the egg prevents curdling
- Makes enough filling for 8-10 cream puffs
