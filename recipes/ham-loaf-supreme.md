# Ham Loaf Supreme

## Main Ingredients

- 1 lb ground smoked ham (I used honey baked and ground in my food processor)
- 1 lb ground lean pork
- 1 ¼ sticks Ritz crackers crushed fine
- ¼ cup finely chopped onion
- 3 well beaten eggs
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 tablespoon minced parsley, fresh or dried (I used fresh)

## Instructions

Mix all the above and divide evenly into 2 greased loaf pans. Bake at 350 degree for 30 minutes. Then pour over the glaze and reduce heat to 325 degrees and bake an additional 50 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before cutting.

## Glaze

- ½ cup dark brown sugar
- ¼ cup cider vinegar
- ¾ teaspoon dry mustard

Bring the glaze mixture to a boil and divide equally and pour over loaves.

## Sauce

- ½ cup mayonnaise
- ½ cup sour cream
- ¼ cup prepared mustard
- 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish
- ½ teaspoon lemon juice

Mix the above and serve with the ham loaf.
