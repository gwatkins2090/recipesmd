# Maui (Pineapple) Scones

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 cup cold Land O Lakes Butter
- 1/2 cup sweetened flaked coconut
- 1/2 cup macadamia and cashew mix, chopped
- 1/4 cup crushed pineapple, drained, reserve 1 tablespoon juice
- 2 Land O Lakes Eggs
- 2 tablespoons sweetened flaked coconut

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 400 degrees F.

2. Combine flour, brown sugar and baking powder in bowl; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in 1/2 cup coconut and macadamia cashew mix. (You may substitute any type of nuts you wish.)

3. Beat pineapple, reserved pineapple juice and eggs in another bowl until well mixed; stir pineapple mixture into flour mixture (mixture may be slightly dry). Knead about 10 times or until mixture forms a dough, adding small amount of flour, if necessary.

4. Divide dough in half. Pat each half into 6-inch circle. Place onto large ungreased baking sheet. Cut each circle into 6 wedges. Do not separate. Sprinkle each circle with 1 tablespoon coconut.

5. Bake 13-15 minutes or until scones are lightly browned. Separate into individual scones.
