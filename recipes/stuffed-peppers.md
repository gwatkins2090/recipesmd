## Ingredients

- 2 large bell peppers, cut in half lengthwise
- 2 tablespoons oleo

- 1 cup cracker crumbs

## Instructions

1. Saute onion in oleo, add V.8. juice, water, chopped ham, salt, pepper, tabasco and cook about 45 minutes over low heat.

2. When this has cooked down add cracker crumbs and egg. Stuff peppers and sprinkle top with cracker crumbs and melted oleo.

3. Bake about 30 minutes in a covered casserole at 350 degrees uncovered, and bake 10 or 15 min. longer.

## Notes

- Unique stuffed peppers using ham instead of ground beef
- Uses spicy Hot V.8. juice for extra flavor (can substitute tomato juice or regular V.8.)
- Ham mixture cooked 45 minutes before stuffing peppers
- Recipe note: "This can be fixed a day or two ahead. Also keeps for refrig. after cooking for several days - also can be frozen before or after cooking."
- Very make-ahead friendly - can freeze before or after cooking
- Two-stage baking: 30 minutes covered, then 10-15 minutes uncovered
- Uses minimal salt since ham is already salty
- Topped with cracker crumbs and melted butter
