# Cranberry Orange Scones

## Ingredients

- 4 C. flour
- 4 t. baking powder
- 3/4 C. sugar
- 1 t. salt
- Grated orange peel from 1 orange
- 1 C. butter, room temperature, cut into small pieces
- 2 large eggs
- 1/3 C. frozen orange juice
- 1/3 C. milk
- 3/4 to 1 Cup (to suit taste) of fresh or frozen cranberries
- 2 tablespoons of light brown sugar

## Instructions

1. Coat cranberries with brown sugar, distributing the sugar so as many cranberries as possible get coated.

2. Combine dry ingredients plus grated orange peel; cut in butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.

3. In small bowl, whisk eggs, orange juice and milk. (Save a couple of tablespoons to brush tops of scones before baking.) Stir into flour mixture, combining until dough is moist. If it is too sticky to handle, add a bit more flour. Mix in the cranberries.

4. Turn dough onto floured work surface; knead a few turns.

5. Divide dough into two balls; pat each into a circle. Cut 6 scones (wedges) from each. Brush with reserved egg mixture.

6. Put on greased cookie sheets and bake at 375 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. Keep checking until they are golden brown.

## Notes

Optional glaze: 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar mixed with 1 tablespoon orange juice (concentrated frozen orange juice yields the best flavor). Drizzle over cooled scones.
