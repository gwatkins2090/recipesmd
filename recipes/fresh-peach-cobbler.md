# Fresh Peach Cobbler

## Ingredients

### Filling
- 1 cup plus 2 tbsp sugar
- 1/8 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp flour, optional
- 2 1/2 lb ripe juicy freestone peaches, 12 to 14 egg-size
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1 to 2 drops almond extract
- Thin cream and sugar

### Pastry
- Pastry for 8-inch double crust, p 924
- 2 tbsp fine dry white bread crumbs, p 168

## Instructions

1. Have ready a 10 1/4 x 6 1/4 x 2-inch glass or aluminum baking pan. Adjust rack to be in middle of oven. Start oven 10 min before baking; set to hot (450° F).

2. Blend sugar, salt and flour—use flour only if peaches are very juicy. Make pastry. Roll out 3/4 of it into a rectangle about 14 1/2 x 10 1/2 inches. Fold in half to lift easily into pan. Unfold carefully so as not to tear pastry, fitting well into angles of pan. Pastry will extend about 1 1/2 inches over pan edge. Sprinkle bread crumbs over bottom of pastry-lined pan, then 1/4 cup of the sugar mixture. Pare peaches, then cut from pits in 6 to 8 lengthwise slices, discarding pits. There should be about 5 cups sliced fruit. Turn peaches into pan, spreading level. Dot with butter and add almond extract. Sprinkle with rest of sugar. Fold extending dough neatly up over peaches; cut out a little square of dough at each corner to prevent the pastry from being too thick. Tuck in ends at the 4 corners neatly. There will be an area of about 2 x 6 inches of peaches in center that will not be covered with pastry. Roll out rest of pastry into a rectangle about 3 x 7 inches. Trim off edges neatly and cut a long design down center for generous steam vents. Lay this pastry over center to cover peaches. Brush entire top lightly but completely with cream, then sprinkle evenly with sugar, a tsp or so, for an interesting surface. Bake 15 to 17 min or until crust starts browning. Now reduce heat to moderately slow (325° F) and bake 25 min longer, or until bottom and top crusts are a rich brown and juice starts bubbling up through vents. Remove to cake rack to cool. Serve lukewarm, plain or with cream. 6 servings.

## Notes

Make this simple but luscious dessert several times during peach season—the family will lick it up!
