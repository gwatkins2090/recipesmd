## Ingredients

- 2 3/4 cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup butter, melted
- 2/3 cup (2/3 can or 2 1/2 oz.) Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk

## Instructions

**Description:** A wonderful rich, crisp cooky. Wonderful for family treats and for special occasions. Makes about 7 1/2 dozen 3-inch diameter cookies.

**Note:** The instructions on the original recipe card are severely faded and largely illegible. Based on partially visible text and standard sugar cookie preparation methods, the instructions likely include:

1. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt in mixing bowl.

2. In separate bowl, combine melted butter, Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk, brown sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and lemon extract. Mix until well blended and smooth.

3. Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients. Mix to form dough.

4. Divide dough into portions and refrigerate/chill until firm enough to roll.

5. Roll out dough to approximately 1/8 inch thickness on floured surface.

6. Cut with cookie cutters (3-inch diameter).

7. Place on greased baking sheets. Sprinkle with cinnamon-flavored sugar.

8. Bake at [temperature not legible] for [time not legible] minutes until edges are lightly browned.

9. Remove to wire racks to cool.

**WARNING:** The original instructions are too faded to read with certainty. The above steps are reconstructed based on partial text visibility and standard baking practices. Baking temperature and time are not visible on the card.
