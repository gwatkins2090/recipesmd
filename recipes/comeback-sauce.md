# Comeback Sauce Recipe

## Description

It's uses are many. It's a dip for vegetables and chips, a salad dressing, a sauce for seafood or a sandwich spread. I will be serving mine tonight with Salmon Patties. It is good on EVERYTHING, except Cheerios. Here's my version that makes a pint jar full.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Duke's mayonnaise (one of my Favorites)
- 1/4 cup Heinz ketchup
- 1/4 cup chili sauce (I prefer Heinz or DelMonte. DO NOT substitute Thai Chili Sauce)
- 1 heaping teaspoon Dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 1 teaspoon ground black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
- 1/4 cup light olive oil
- juice of one lemon

## Instructions

Mix all ingredients well and store in refrigerator overnight. It needs to sit to let the flavors become "acquainted". They shouldn't rush into marriage.

## Notes

- Typed recipe with personality and humor
- Strong brand preferences noted (Duke's mayonnaise, Heinz products)
- Warning about Thai Chili Sauce substitution
- Emphasis on overnight refrigeration for flavor development
