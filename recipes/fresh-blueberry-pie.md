# Fresh Blueberry Pie

## Ingredients

### Pastry
- Pastry for 9-inch double crust, p 924
- 1 tbsp fine dry white bread crumbs, p 985

### Filling
- 4 qt blueberries
- 3 tbsp flour
- 1 cup sugar
- Dash of salt
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp butter, optional

## Instructions

1. Adjust rack 4 or 5 inches above bottom of oven. Start oven 10 min before baking; set to hot (450° F).

2. Make pastry; roll out 2/3 of it and line a 9-inch pie pan, fitting well into angles; trim off even with pan rim. Sprinkle crumbs evenly over bottom of pastry-lined pan. Roll out remaining pastry for top crust, cut design in center for wide-open steam vents. Pick over berries, discarding damaged ones and wash thoroughly in cold water. Drain. Blend flour with sugar and salt and sprinkle 1/3 cup of it over crumbs, then turn in berries, spreading out compactly. Drizzle lemon juice over berries, then sprinkle rest of sugar mixture over top. Dot with butter, then moisten edge of lower pastry; lay on top pastry. Press gently around edge to seal. Trim off top pastry with scissors 1/2-inch beyond pan rim. Fold overhang under bottom pastry so fold is even with pan rim. Again press gently to seal, then crimp edge with tines of a fork.

3. Bake 12 to 15 min or until pastry begins to brown, then reduce heat to moderately slow (325° F) and bake 20 to 25 min longer or until pastry is nicely browned and juice bubbles up through vents. Remove to cake rack to cool to lukewarm. 5 to 6 servings.
