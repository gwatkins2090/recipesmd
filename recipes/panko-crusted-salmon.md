# Panko-crusted Salmon Recipe

## Description

Panko is a Japanese type of bread crumb that is especially light and crunchy, popular these days with chefs because it doesn't get soggy. What I love about this way of preparing salmon is that the panko topping seems to hold in the salmon's moisture while roasting, so the salmon doesn't get dried out at all.

## Ingredients

- 4 teaspoons olive oil
- 4 pieces thickly cut, boneless salmon (each 6 oz)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 Tbsp honey mustard or sweet-hot mustard
- 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme
- 2/3 cup panko bread crumbs
- 2 Tbsp chopped Italian parsley
- 1/2 teaspoon Hungarian sweet paprika

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 400°F (convection or regular). Set the salmon on a foil-lined baking sheet skin side down. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

2. In a small bowl, combine the honey mustard and 1 teaspoon of the thyme. In another small bowl, mix the panko with the remaining 1 teaspoon of thyme, 4 teaspoons of olive oil, parsley, and paprika. Add salt and pepper (a light sprinkle).
