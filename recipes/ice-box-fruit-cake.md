# Ice Box Fruit Cake

## Ingredients

- 1 Big Box Honey Graham Crackers
- 1 10-16 oz. jar Maraschino cherries
- 1 stick butter, or oleo
- 1/2 box raisins if desired
- Add enough pecans to suit your taste
- 1 large package of marshmallows

## Instructions

1. Drain cherries. Save juice to add to cake if it needs more moisture to cake mixture.

2. Melt marshmallows and butter over low heat.

3. Add crushed graham crackers, chopped cherries, raisins and nuts.

4. Mix well and put into a buttered loaf pan (we use a glass pan).

5. Refrigerate 12 hours or longer. Best if longer than 12 hours.

6. Remove cake from pan. Wrap in aluminum foil or plastic wrap.

## Notes

We like it without raisins, but you will need more cherries. Cake keeps refrigerated for weeks. We cut the slices we want to eat and return uncut loaf to refrigerator.
