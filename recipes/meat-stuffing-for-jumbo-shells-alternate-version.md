# Meat Stuffing for Jumbo Shells (Alternate Version)

## Notes

They thaw slightly, and freeze apart from sauce. They can be frozen quickly on cookie sheet and store in plastic bag. This method will prevent sticking together.

(I use the lean ground beef) another version of stuffing:

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 lbs. coarsely ground cooked meat or lean ground beef cooked until all pink is gone
- 2 eggs slightly beaten
- 1/2 cup finely minced onions
- 1 cup dried bread crumbs
- 1/2 tsp salt (optional)
- 3/4 to 1 tsp. Oregano - crushed
- 1/8 tsp pepper (salt to taste)

## Instructions

Moisten with milk if desired. Mix thoroughly and proceed as in previous recipe.
