# Apple Crisp

## Ingredients

- 1 large #2 sugar coated apple pie filling (or sweetened with Splenda, Bayless Cherry)
- 1 box Pillsbury yellow cake mix (50% reduced sugar)
- 1/2 stick melted butter or margarine
- 1/2 cup chopped pecans

## Instructions

### Base Layer
Pour pie filling into greased 2 qt casserole dish. (Note: Use 1/2 cup apples or fruit need not be large pieces.) Add 1/3-1/4 cup water to pie filling to keep it from being dry.

### Topping
1. Sprinkle 1/3 - 1/2 box cake mix evenly over apples.

2. Spread chopped pecans over cake mix.

3. Drizzle butter over pecans.

4. Bake at 375Â° for 30 minutes or until lightly browned.

## Notes

- Health-conscious version using reduced sugar products and Splenda
- Mentions "Bayless Cherry" as alternative to apple
- Very simple assembly - no mixing required
- Cake mix forms crispy topping when baked
- Can use half the fruit or cut fruit into smaller pieces
- Perfect for quick dessert or potluck
