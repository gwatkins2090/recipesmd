## Description

Mississippi's famous comeback sauce - a tangy, slightly spicy condiment that goes with everything. Once you try it, you'll understand why it's called "comeback" sauce.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Duke's mayonnaise (one of my Favorites)
- ¼ cup Heinz ketchup
- ¼ cup chili sauce (I prefer Heinz or DelMonte. DO NOT substitute Thai Chili Sauce)
- 1 heaping tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tsp onion powder
- ½ tsp garlic powder
- 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp ground black pepper
- ¼ tsp Tabasco sauce
- ¼ cup light olive oil
- juice of one lemon

## Instructions

1. Mix all ingredients well and store in refrigerator overnight. It needs to sit to let the flavors become acquainted. They shouldn't rush into marriage.
