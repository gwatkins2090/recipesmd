### Instructions
In heavy duty foil or (Bieren in bag) sprinkle roast with onion soup mix and mushroom soup - seal and bake in 350° oven 30 minutes per pound.

I usually cook 4 or 5 pound roast and use 2 packages (envelopes) of onion soup mix and about 6 to 8 cans of mushroom soup, also I add about 4 cans of water. I have always used cooking bags. After cooking 30 mins per pound I cut the bag, remove to roast and slice it with electric knife. Leave it in the gravy, add more water if too thick and return to oven until meat is as tender as you like.

Always be careful to use pot glove and read cooking bags instructions and be sure to make several slits in top of bag.

**I usually cook a 4-5 pound roast.**

### Add:
- 2 Packages (2 envelopes) of dry onion soup mix
- 6-8 cans of Golden mushroom soup
- 4 cans of water

I always cook the roast in cooking bags.

After cooking at 350 degrees for 30 minutes per pound of meat, I cut the bag, remove the roast and slice roast into pieces the size you want to serve with electric knife.

Discard bag.

Leave the pieces in the gravy in pan and add more water if gravy is too thick.

Return to oven and continue cooking until roast is as tender as you like.

Also, read the cooking bag instruction and be sure to make slits in the top of the bag.

We like a lot of gravy so that is why I use a lot of soup.

This freezes well, for later use and good eating.
