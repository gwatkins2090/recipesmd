# Pudding, Glorious Pudding - Crescent City Grill Bread Pudding

## Ingredients

### Crescent City Grill Bread Pudding
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1 cup sugar
- 5 eggs
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 cup raisins
- 2 large loaves sourdough bread, crusts cut off, cubed

### Jack Daniels Sauce for Bread Pudding

- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1 tablespoon water
- 2 tablespoons Jack Daniels

## Instructions

### Bread Pudding
Cream butter and sugar, add eggs, heavy cream, vanilla and cinnamon. Place liquid ingredients and half the bread into the bowl of an electric mixer and begin mixing on slowest speed. As bread begins to break up add more bread to the bowl until the mixture becomes like a damp (not too wet) mush. Add raisins and place all into a greased casserole dish (in a water bath) and bake covered at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake another 15 minutes until a toothpick stuck into the center comes out clean.

### Jack Daniels Sauce
Bring cream, sugar, cinnamon and butter to a boil and stir until sugar dissolves. Separately, dissolve the cornstarch and water. Add the cornstarch mixture to the hot sauce and cook until thickened. Remove from heat. Add the Jack Daniels.
