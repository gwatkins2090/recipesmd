## Recommended Review Process

### Phase 1: High Priority (Recipes 1-6)
These recipes have significant uncertainties that may prevent successful recreation. Review these first.

### Phase 2: Medium Priority (Recipes 7-25)
These recipes have 2-3 uncertainties but are mostly complete and usable.

### Phase 3: Low Priority (Recipes 26-33)
These recipes have minor uncertainties that don't significantly impact usability.

## Tips for Resolving Uncertainties

1. **Use context clues** - Compare similar recipes in the collection
2. **Check standard measurements** - Cooking measurements follow patterns (1/4, 1/2, 1, 2 cups, etc.)
3. **Research the recipe** - Google the recipe name to find similar versions
4. **Ask family members** - They may remember making these recipes
5. **Use common sense** - Does the interpretation make culinary sense?

---

## After Resolving Uncertainties

1. **Edit the markdown file** using a text editor
2. **Remove the [UNCERTAIN: ] tags** and replace with verified text
3. **Add a note** in the Notes section: "Verified against original PDF on [date]"
4. **Consider adding** any additional context from the PDF (stains, notes, condition)

---

## Example Edit

**Before:**
```markdown
- [UNCERTAIN: porne] barley
```

**After (if verified as "pearl"):**
```markdown
- pearl barley
```

**Notes section addition:**
```markdown
## Notes

Verified against original PDF Part-3 on 2025-10-18. First ingredient confirmed as "pearl barley" though handwriting was unclear.
```
