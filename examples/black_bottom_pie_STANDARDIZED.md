## Description

Black Bottom Pie is a beloved Southern dessert that combines two distinct custard layers - a rich chocolate bottom and a light, airy vanilla top - all nestled in a buttery pie crust. The name comes from the dark chocolate layer that forms the "black bottom" of the pie. This elegant dessert is perfect for dinner parties and special occasions, and it can be made a day ahead for convenience.

## Ingredients

### For the Custard Filling
- 3 cups whole milk
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 4 large eggs, separated
- 2 envelopes (4½ tsp) unflavored gelatin
- 1/4 cup cold water
- 1 oz semi-sweet chocolate, chopped
- 2 tsp vanilla extract, divided
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar (for meringue)

### For the Crust and Topping
- 1 (9-inch) baked pie shell or graham cracker crust
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream, whipped (or fat-free Cool Whip)
- Semi-sweet chocolate for grating (garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the custard base:** In a medium saucepan, scald the milk over medium heat until small bubbles form around the edges. Do not boil.

2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a small bowl, thoroughly mix together 1 cup sugar and flour.

3. **Temper the eggs:** Beat egg yolks in a separate bowl until lemon colored. Gradually add the hot milk mixture to the egg yolks, stirring constantly to prevent curdling.

4. **Cook the custard:** Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 10-15 minutes).

5. **Add gelatin:** While custard is cooking, soften the gelatin in cold water. Once custard has thickened, add the softened gelatin and stir until completely dissolved.

6. **Divide the mixture:** Pour the custard into two equal portions (about 1½ cups each).

7. **Make chocolate layer:** To one portion, add the chopped chocolate and stir until completely melted and smooth. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and stir well. Allow to cool slightly, then pour into the baked pie shell. Refrigerate while preparing the top layer.

8. **Make vanilla layer:** To the remaining custard portion, add the second teaspoon of vanilla extract. Allow to cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally.

9. **Prepare meringue (traditional method):** Beat 2 egg whites until soft peaks form. Gradually add 1/4 cup sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the cooled vanilla custard.

10. **Assemble the pie:** Once the chocolate layer has set slightly (about 30 minutes in refrigerator), carefully spread the vanilla meringue mixture over the chocolate layer.

11. **Chill:** Refrigerate the pie for at least 2-3 hours or until completely set.

12. **Garnish and serve:** Before serving, spread whipped cream over the top of the pie and grate a small amount of semi-sweet chocolate over the whipped cream for garnish.

## Notes

### Storage
- Store covered in refrigerator for up to 3 days
- Best served chilled
- Can be made 1 day ahead

### Make-Ahead Tips
- The pie actually improves when made a day ahead, allowing flavors to meld
- Add whipped cream topping just before serving for best presentation

### Recipe Modifications
The original recipe has been updated with the following changes:
- Increased gelatin from 1 to 2 envelopes for better setting
- Sugar is now mixed with flour before adding to milk
- Option to use fat-free Cool Whip instead of beaten egg whites and whipped cream for a lighter version

## Variations

### Lighter Version
- Fold 1/4 cup or more of fat-free Cool Whip into the vanilla custard instead of beaten egg whites
- Top with Cool Whip instead of whipped cream
- Reduces calories and fat content significantly

### Graham Cracker Crust Version
- Use a graham cracker crust instead of traditional pie crust for a different texture and flavor
- The sweetness of graham crackers complements the chocolate layer beautifully

### Chocolate Garnish Options
- Grate dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet for a more intense flavor
- Add chocolate curls for an elegant presentation
- Dust with cocoa powder for a simpler finish
